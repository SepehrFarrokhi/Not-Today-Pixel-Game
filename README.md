🛡️ NOT TODAY! 🛡️
"They say nobody survives Phase 10. I say: Not Today."

Not Today is a creative explosion of arcade-style combat and strategic survival. Starting as a lone survivor with a basic pistol, you must blast through 10 escalating phases of pixel-art chaos.

What makes it hype?

The Shop Strategy: Do you spend your points on raw speed, or do you save up for the game-changing Nova Blast and Missile Support?

Boss Diplomacy: These aren't just bullet sponges. The bosses in Not Today use tactical orbital strikes, spawn reinforcements, and teleport to keep you on your toes.

The Flow: With built-in screen shake, hit flashes, and a custom particle system, every kill feels rewarding and every narrow escape feels legendary.

📝 Creative "Dev Diary" Intro (Showing your Vision)
"I started Not Today to explore the 'Game Juice' philosophy—making a simple shooter feel heavy, intense, and addictive. This repository tracks the evolution from a basic movement script to a full-featured survival experience. Currently in active development, moving toward more complex enemy AI and even crazier weapon synergies."
